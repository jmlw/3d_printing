## Mods

### [ArmoredTurtle BoxTurtle](https://github.com/ArmoredTurtle/BoxTurtle)

#### Guidler

Modified guidler built-in support to include a branch that touches the print bed ensuring better stability of the support rather than relying on floating printed bridges remaining in place and resucing the chance of a failed print. I found this to be much more reliable and was able to easily batch them in a single print.
