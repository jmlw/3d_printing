## Mods

### [ArmoredTurtle BoxTurtle](https://github.com/ArmoredTurtle/BoxTurtle)

#### [Guidler](mods/ArmoredTurtle/BoxTurtle/Extruder)

Modified guidler built-in support to include a branch that touches the print bed ensuring better stability of the support rather than relying on floating printed bridges remaining in place and resucing the chance of a failed print. I found this to be much more reliable and was able to easily batch them in a single print.

### [Dragon Burner Cutter](https://github.com/chirpy2605/voron/tree/main/V0/Dragon_Burner_Cutter)

#### [Cutter Trigger](mods/Dragon_Burner_Cutter)

Custom trigger arm for the Dragon Burner Cutter to work for a Voron Trident using the Dragon Burner toolhead with the Dragon Burner Cutter and MGN9H X Gantry mount.
