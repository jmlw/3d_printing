# [Crossbow Filament Cutter](https://github.com/DW-Tas/Crossbow-Filament-Cutter)

## Sherpa Mini Mount Spacer

The Crossbow Filament Cutter has STLs available to mount the cutter to a Dragon Burner either above the standard Sherpa Mini pattern mount or in place of the sherpa pattern mount with the custom cowl provided. The Shepra Mini (printed or CNC) does not have enough clearance from the top of the [Crossbow cutter holder](https://github.com/DW-Tas/Crossbow-Filament-Cutter/blob/main/STL/Dragon%20Burner%20example/Crossbow%20cutter%20holder%20-%20WW-BMG%20(Sherpa-Mini%20spacing%29%20-%20Dragon%20Burner.stl) to the bottom of the Sherpa Mini preventing the cutter from fully actuating.

The Sherpa Mini Mount Spacer simply sits between the cutter holder and Sherpa Mini providing enough clearance to fully actuate the cutter without interfering or requireing modification of the Sherpa Mini. A small bowden tube segment should fully pass from the Sherpa Mini through the spacer and to the top of the cutter holder.
